Here is a simple way to insert an amusing image:

![](ten-min-per-day.gif)

Here is my prefered way to insert an image, giving me more control over the caption and size (Figure \@ref(fig:cartoon)):

```{r cartoon, fig.cap="A silly cartoon", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("ten-min-per-day.gif")
```
